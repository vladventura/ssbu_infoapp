SO! The assets (besides the JSON database) I've separated them from the project because it's using unneeded space, right? To make them work just [click here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qDonB3sH4QQm_mH4HI5sMVQeVM7q41MD) to download a rar file that will have the latest assets version, which should go hand in hand with the current pull to the develop branch because it makes sense, right?

**Clone the repo**: `git clone github.com/vladventura/ssbu_info.git`<br />
**Start Flutter from fresh**: `flutter create .` inside the cloned repo

That's all you need! Make sure to download the assets and extract them inside the assets folder. Thank you so much!
